# These are all my dotfiles past and present
If something looks weird or strange it's probably becuase I don't use it anymore
# REMEMBER when setting up system
vis, htop-vim, sh, cfetch, vifm, mupdf, qutebrowser/Vieb, groff, dwm, st, slstatus - install all these
Remember that I need to create a vim symlink to vis/viz
